# Mastering System Design: Performance Concepts, Tools & Techniques

Performance is the heart of modern system design. It's not just about how fast your system runs — it's about how well it scales, how it responds under pressure, and how efficiently it utilizes resources. In this chapter, we'll break down the essential pillars of performance: latency, throughput, caching, messaging queues, concurrency, and database optimization.

## Introduction to System Performance

Performance in system design is a **multidimensional goal** — balancing speed, scalability, and efficiency:

- **Speed:** How quickly does your system respond? (Measured as latency.)
- **Capacity:** How much work can it handle at once? (Measured as throughput.)
- **Efficiency:** How well does it use resources under stress? (CPU, memory, network.)

> **Performance is not a single metric — it's about achieving the right balance for your application.**

### Why Performance Matters

- **User expectations:** Slow systems lose users and revenue.
- **Business impact:** Performance affects drop-offs, bounce rates, and costs.
- **System stability:** Poor performance leads to instability and outages.

> **Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.**

## Key Metrics — Latency, Throughput, Scalability & Responsiveness

### Latency vs. Throughput

| Metric      | Description                          | Unit       | Affects                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|
| Latency     | Time to process a single request     | ms, s      | Responsiveness         |
| Throughput  | Requests processed per second        | RPS, TPS   | Scalability            |

> **Note:** Low latency ≠ high throughput. Both must be balanced per use case.

### Code: Measuring Latency and Throughput (Python)

```python
import time
import requests

def measure_latency(url):
    start = time.time()
    response = requests.get(url)
    latency = time.time() - start
    return latency

def measure_throughput(url, n_requests):
    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(n_requests):
        requests.get(url)
    total_time = time.time() - start
    return n_requests / total_time

print("Latency:", measure_latency("https://example.com"))
print("Throughput:", measure_throughput("https://example.com", 100), "req/sec")
```

### Diagram: Latency vs. Throughput

```
|--- Latency ---|
[Client]----request---->[Server]----response---->[Client]
            (1 request)
Throughput = Requests handled in 1 second
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: Request 1
    Server-->>Client: Response 1 (Latency)
    Client->>Server: Request 2
    Server-->>Client: Response 2
    Note over Server: Throughput = Total requests/time
```

### Scalability vs. Responsiveness

- **Scalability:** Can the system handle more load as users/data grow?
  - **Horizontal scaling:** Adding more servers.
  - **Vertical scaling:** Increasing resources of existing servers.
- **Responsiveness:** How quickly the system replies, even under heavy load. Tightly linked to latency.

> **Goal:** Good design should ensure responsiveness at scale.

---

## Measuring Performance — SLAs, SLOs, SLIs, and Percentiles

### SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs

- **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** External contractual performance guarantee.
- **SLO (Service Level Objective):** Internal performance target.
- **SLI (Service Level Indicator):** Actual measured value.

**Example:**

```
SLA: 99.9% uptime for customers
SLO: 95% of requests < 300ms latency
SLI: Actual: 93% of requests < 300ms (need improvement!)
```

### Percentiles: P50, P95, P99

**Why not just use averages?** Because averages hide outliers.

- **P50:** 50% (median) requests are faster.
- **P95:** 95% of requests are faster; 5% are slower.
- **P99:** The slowest 1% (tail latency) — critical for user experience.

**Visualization:**

```
|----|------------------|------------------|------------------|----|
  0%   50% (P50)         95% (P95)          99% (P99)         100%
```

## Performance Testing & Monitoring

### Performance Testing Types

| Type             | Description               | Goal                        |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Load Testing     | Normal expected load      | Baseline performance        |
| Stress Testing   | Beyond normal load        | Graceful degradation/crash  |
| Spike Testing    | Sudden burst load         | Absorb traffic spikes       |
| Endurance (Soak) | Extended duration load    | Memory leaks / fatigue      |

**Goal:** Identify bottlenecks & ensure reliability.

#### CLI Example: Load Testing with `wrk`

```bash
wrk -t8 -c400 -d30s https://yourapi.com/api/endpoint
```

### Performance Monitoring

- **Testing** is pre-deployment; **monitoring** is continuous in production.
- **APM tools:** New Relic, Datadog.
- **Logs & metrics:** ELK stack, Prometheus + Grafana.

**What to track:**

- Latency & throughput.
- Error rates.
- Resource usage (CPU, memory, DB queries).

---

## Caching for Speed Optimization

Caching is one of the most powerful levers for reducing latency, easing backend load, and scaling systems.

### Why Caching Matters

- **Reducing latency:** Serve requests in milliseconds by avoiding repeated trips to databases or recomputing results.
- **Easing backend load:** Offload expensive queries or computations from databases.
- **Improving scalability:** Handle more users with the same infrastructure.
- **Enhancing user experience:** Faster response times = happier users.

**Diagram: Caching in a Web Application**

```mermaid

    User-->|HTTP Request| WebServer
    WebServer-->|Check Cache| Cache[(In-memory Cache)]

                  ^             |
                  |<-- cache hit|
```

### Types of Caching

| Type                | Where it Lives             | Example Tools / Tech                   | Use Case                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Client-side**     | User's browser/device      | localStorage, Service Workers, IndexedDB | Offline support, quick navigation        |
| **Server-side**     | Application server memory  | Redis, Memcached                       | Session tokens, user data, computed results|
| **CDN caching**     | Content Delivery Networks  | Cloudflare, Akamai                     | Static assets (JS, CSS, images), API responses |
| **Database caching**| Database result-set cache  | Redis, Materialized Views              | Expensive queries, analytics              |

### Caching Strategies

#### 1. Write-Through Caching

(See `image-10.png` for diagram.)

- **How it works:** Data is written to both the cache and the database at the same time.
- **Pro:** Consistency is guaranteed; cache is always fresh.
- **Con:** Adds latency to write operations.

```python
def write(key, value):
    cache.set(key, value)  # Update cache
    db.save(key, value)    # Update database
```

#### 2. Write-Back (Write-Behind) Caching

(See `image-11.png`.)

- **How it works:** Data is written to the cache first and asynchronously persisted to the database later.
- **Pro:** Fast write performance.
- **Con:** Risk of data loss if cache fails before DB is updated.

```python
def write(key, value):
    cache.set(key, value)
    # Schedule async write to DB
    schedule_async_db_write(key, value)
```

#### 3. Lazy Loading (Cache-Aside)

(See `image-12.png`.)

- **How it works:** On reads, check cache first. If not found (cache miss), fetch from DB, return, and populate cache.
- **Pro:** Only hot (frequently accessed) data is cached.
- **Con:** First access is slow ("cold" cache).

```python
def read(key):
    value = cache.get(key)
    if value is None:
        value = db.get(key)
        cache.set(key, value)
    return value
```

#### 4. Explicit / Manual Caching

- **How it works:** Developers decide explicitly when and what to cache.
- **Pro:** Maximum flexibility.
- **Con:** Higher complexity, risk of staleness if not managed well.

### Cache Eviction Policies

(See `image-13.png`.)

Caches have limited memory, so old or less useful data must be evicted.

| Policy                          | Description                              | When to Use                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **LRU (Least Recently Used)**   | Remove the least recently accessed item  | Default choice, general use              |
| **LFU (Least Frequently Used)** | Remove item with fewest access hits      | When some items are rarely used          |
| **FIFO (First In, First Out)**  | Remove oldest item added                 | Simplicity, but less intelligent         |
| **TTL (Time To Live)**          | Expire items after a fixed time          | Time-sensitive data (API responses, sessions) |

### Redis: The Caching Powerhouse

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory key-value store, renowned for its blazing speed:

- **Ultra-fast access:** Everything is in RAM.
- **Supports TTL:** Automatic expiry of keys.
- **Persistence:** Can save cache to disk for durability.
- **Pub/Sub messaging:** For real-time event systems.
- **Versatile:** Caching, queues, session storage, leaderboards.

**Redis caching in Python:**

```python
import redis

cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

def get_user_profile(user_id):
    cached = cache.get(f"profile:{user_id}")
    if cached:
        return cached
    profile = db_get_profile(user_id)
    cache.setex(f"profile:{user_id}", 60, profile)  # 60s TTL
    return profile
```

A simpler version:

```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Set cache with 10-minute TTL
r.setex('user:123', 600, '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}')

# Get cache
user_data = r.get('user:123')
```

**LRU cache in Python (`functools`):**

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_product(product_id):
    # Simulate DB fetch
    return fetch_product_from_db(product_id)
```

**Redis caching in Node.js + Express:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const redis = require('redis');
const app = express();

const redisClient = redis.createClient(); // default localhost:6379

app.get('/api/product/:id', async (req, res) => {
    const productId = req.params.id;

    redisClient.get(`product:${productId}`, async (err, cached) => {
        if (cached) {
            return res.json(JSON.parse(cached)); // Cache hit
        }

        // Simulate DB fetch
        const product = await fetchProductFromDB(productId);

        // Cache with TTL of 10 minutes
        redisClient.setex(`product:${productId}`, 600, JSON.stringify(product));

        res.json(product);
    });
});

function fetchProductFromDB(productId) {
    return Promise.resolve({ id: productId, name: "Sample Product" });
}

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on port 3000"));
```

### Real-World Caching Examples

- **CDN:** Static assets (images, JS, CSS) cached near users for instant load times.
- **E-commerce:** Product catalog queries cached to avoid repeated expensive DB hits.
- **User sessions:** Session data stored in Redis for quick login checks.
- **Search:** Frequently searched keywords/results cached to save compute cycles.
- **Microservices:** API responses cached to reduce downstream service load.

| Use Case               | Cache Type   | Tool             |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Static assets (images) | CDN          | Cloudflare       |
| User sessions          | Server-side  | Redis            |
| Product page data      | Server-side  | Redis/Memcached  |
| API responses          | Server-side  | Redis            |

### Caching — Tips & Tricks

- **Always measure:** Use metrics to identify what should be cached (hot queries).
- **Apply TTL smartly:** Especially on volatile or time-sensitive data.
- **Prevent cache stampede:** Use locks or request coalescing to avoid thundering herd problems.
- **Monitor cache health:** Watch hit/miss rates, eviction rates, memory usage.
- **Automate cache invalidation:** Design carefully for dynamic content (on writes or updates).
- **Choose the right cache layer:** Not all data should be cached everywhere.
- **Secure your caches:** Protect against unauthorized access for sensitive data.
- **Combine eviction policies:** E.g., LRU + TTL for the best of both worlds.

## Messaging & Queues for Decoupling

Asynchronous messaging **decouples** services, boosts scalability, and enhances resilience.

### Why Use Asynchronous Messaging?

Traditional synchronous calls force producers (e.g., APIs) to wait for consumers (e.g., email sender, payment processor) to finish their work. This **tightly couples** services and limits scalability.

(See `image-14.png` for sync vs. async comparison.)

**Asynchronous messaging decouples these components:**

- **Loose coupling:** Producers and consumers don't need to know about each other.
- **Performance:** Producers can send messages and move on immediately.
- **Scalability:** Consumers can scale independently.
- **Resilience:** If a consumer fails, messages are not lost.
- **Flexibility:** Add new consumers without touching producers.

### Core Concepts

(See `image-15.png` for architecture overview.)

| Concept       | Description                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Message**   | Packet of data (JSON, binary, etc.)                         |
| **Producer**  | Sends message (e.g., order service)                         |
| **Consumer**  | Receives and processes messages (e.g., inventory updater)   |
| **Broker**    | Middleware that stores and routes messages (RabbitMQ, Kafka)|
| **Queue/Topic** | Logical channel for delivery                              |
| **Ack**       | Acknowledgement from consumer after successful processing   |

### Typical Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer
    participant Broker
    participant Consumer
    Producer->>Broker: Send message (e.g., "OrderPlaced")
    Broker->>Consumer: Deliver message
    Consumer->>Broker: Ack (after processing)
```

For a **pub/sub event bus**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Producer["Producer (Catalog Service)"] -->|Publish Event| Broker["Event Bus (e.g., Kafka)"]
    Broker -->|Subscribed| Consumer1["Basket Service"]
    Broker -->|Subscribed| Consumer2["Billing Service"]
    Broker -->|Subscribed| Consumer3["Analytics Service"]
```

A simpler view:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Producer] -- Sends Message --> B[Message Broker / Queue]
    B -- Delivers --> C[Consumer 1]
    B -- Delivers --> D[Consumer 2]
```

### Real-World Example: Decoupled Order Processing

(See `image-16.png` for diagram.)

1. **Catalog Service** updates a product price.
2. After DB update, it publishes a `PriceUpdated` event to the broker.
3. **Basket Service** receives the event and updates any cart items with the old price.
4. **Billing** and **Analytics** services also subscribe to the event and trigger their own logic.
5. If any consumer is down, the message stays in the queue until it's back.

**Benefits:**

- **No direct calls** between services = no tight coupling.
- **Downstream failures** don't block the producer.
- **Easy to add new consumers** (e.g., promotions service).

### When to Use Queues?

- **Bursty workloads:** Traffic spikes (flash sales), batch imports.
- **Background jobs:** Emails, processing, report generation, exports.
- **Rate limiting / expensive ops:** Spreading out heavy API calls or processing.
- **Buffering:** Smoothing out peaks to avoid overloading downstream systems.
- **Decoupling between services.**

### Popular Message Brokers: RabbitMQ vs. Kafka

#### RabbitMQ — Traditional Message Broker

- Built on AMQP, designed for reliable message delivery.
- Follows a **push-based model:** messages are pushed to consumers.
- Supports acknowledgements, retries, and dead-letter queues.
- Great for task distribution, background jobs, and real-time notifications.
- Focuses on **routing flexibility** (direct, topic, fanout exchanges).
- Messages are **removed after consumption.**

#### Kafka — Distributed Event Streaming Platform

- Built for **high-throughput**, durable, distributed event logs.
- Uses a **pull-based model:** consumers read at their own pace.
- Stores messages in **partitioned logs;** supports message replay.
- Ideal for **event sourcing**, **real-time analytics**, and **stream processing**.
- Highly **scalable and fault-tolerant.**
- Messages are **retained for configurable durations** (even after consumption).

#### RabbitMQ vs Kafka

| Feature        | RabbitMQ                          | Kafka                                |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Type**       | Message broker (AMQP)             | Event streaming platform             |
| **Model**      | Push-based                        | Pull-based                           |
| **Delivery**   | Messages delivered to consumers   | Consumers fetch from log             |
| **Use Case**   | Task queues, notifications, jobs  | Event sourcing, analytics, ETL       |
| **Retention**  | Message gone after consumption    | Retained for days; supports replay   |
| **Routing**    | Flexible (direct, topic, fanout)  | Partitioned topics                   |
| **Scale**      | Good                              | Excellent (built for high throughput)|

### Delivery Guarantees

- **At-least-once** (default): Message retried until acknowledged; possible duplicates. *Consumer must be idempotent.*
- **At-most-once:** Message delivered only once (no retries); possible loss.
- **Exactly-once:** Processed once and only once; hardest to implement, supported by Kafka under constraints.

### Sample Code: Publishing & Consuming Messages

#### Example 1: RabbitMQ (Python with `pika`)

**Producer:**

```python
import pika

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()
channel.queue_declare(queue='tasks')
channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='tasks', body='Hello World!')
connection.close()
```

A second producer variant:

```python
import pika

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()
channel.queue_declare(queue='orders')

channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='orders', body='{"order_id": 123}')
print("Sent order message.")
connection.close()
```

**Consumer (auto-ack):**

```python
def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(f"Received {body}")

channel.basic_consume(queue='tasks', on_message_callback=callback, auto_ack=True)
channel.start_consuming()
```

**Consumer (with explicit ack):**

```python
import pika

def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(f"Received {body}")
    # process order...
    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag)

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()
channel.queue_declare(queue='orders')
channel.basic_consume(queue='orders', on_message_callback=callback)

print('Waiting for messages...')
channel.start_consuming()
```

**Consumer with durable queue:**

```python
import pika

def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print("Received %r" % body)
    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag)

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()
channel.queue_declare(queue='task_queue', durable=True)
channel.basic_consume(queue='task_queue', on_message_callback=callback)
channel.start_consuming()
```

#### Example 2: Kafka (Node.js with `kafkajs`)

**Producer:**

```js
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');
const kafka = new Kafka({ clientId: 'producer', brokers: ['localhost:9092'] });

const producer = kafka.producer();
await producer.connect();
await producer.send({
  topic: 'order-events',
  messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify({ orderId: 123 }) }],
});
await producer.disconnect();
```

**Consumer:**

```js
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');
const kafka = new Kafka({ clientId: 'consumer', brokers: ['localhost:9092'] });

const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'order-group' });
await consumer.connect();
await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'order-events', fromBeginning: true });

await consumer.run({
  eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
    const order = JSON.parse(message.value.toString());
    console.log('Received order:', order);
    // process order...
  }
});
```

### Messaging — Best Practices

- **Idempotent consumers:** Ensure re-processing a message doesn't cause incorrect results.
- **Dead-letter queues (DLQ):** Capture and inspect messages that fail multiple times.
- **Monitor queues:** Track length and processing time to detect bottlenecks.
- **Graceful retries:** Use exponential backoff or circuit breakers.
- **Choose guarantees wisely:** At-least-once is common, but know your requirements.
- **Security:** Encrypt messages, use authentication & authorization.

### Messaging — Tips & Tricks

- **Make operations idempotent:** Store processed message IDs or use database upserts.
- **Use DLQs:** Never silently drop or lose failing messages.
- **Monitor and alert:** Set up alerts for queue length, processing failures, and latency.
- **Don't block consumers:** Design consumers to be fast and non-blocking.
- **Automate scaling:** Use auto-scaling for consumer groups based on queue depth.
- **Tune prefetch/batch sizes:** For RabbitMQ, set channel prefetch; for Kafka, tune consumer batch size.

## Concurrency & Parallelism

Unlocking performance often means handling **many tasks at once** — but how?

### Concurrency vs. Parallelism

(See `image-17.png` for diagram.)

| Aspect        | Concurrency                                       | Parallelism                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Definition    | Multiple tasks start/run/complete in overlapping time | Multiple tasks executed *simultaneously* |
| Hardware      | Single or multi-core                              | Multi-core required                    |
| Focus         | Task management (responsiveness)                  | Task execution (throughput)            |
| Example       | Async web server                                  | Matrix computation on threads          |

**Concurrency** is about *managing* multiple tasks at the same time. These tasks may overlap in their execution, but do not necessarily run simultaneously. It allows a system to handle multiple things at once, improving responsiveness, even on a single CPU core.

- Task management, not simultaneous execution.
- Can be achieved on a single-core CPU.
- Gives the *illusion* of doing many things at once by rapidly switching context.

**Example:** A web server handling multiple HTTP requests using asynchronous I/O.

```python
# Python asyncio concurrent server (single-threaded, concurrent)
import asyncio

async def handle_request(reader, writer):
    data = await reader.read(100)
    message = data.decode()
    print(f"Received {message}")
    writer.write(data)
    await writer.drain()
    writer.close()

async def main():
    server = await asyncio.start_server(handle_request, '127.0.0.1', 8888)
    async with server:
        await server.serve_forever()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Parallelism** is about *executing* multiple tasks at the same time. It requires multiple CPU cores. The goal is to increase *throughput* and speed.

- Actual simultaneous execution.
- Requires multi-core CPUs.
- Improves throughput and computational speed.

**Example:** Parallel matrix computation.

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def compute_square(x):
    return x * x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Pool(4) as p:  # 4 parallel processes
        results = p.map(compute_square, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
    print(results)
```

**Concurrency vs. Parallelism ASCII:**

```
Concurrency (Task Management)        Parallelism (Task Execution)
+------------------------------+     +--------------------------+
| Task A  | Task B | Task C    |     | Task A | Task B | Task C |
|========>|========|=========> |     |========|========|========|
|    (Interleaved, Overlapping)|     |(Executed Simultaneously)|
+------------------------------+     +--------------------------+
```

### Processes vs. Threads

(See `image-18.png` for diagram.)

|                 | Process                          | Thread                       |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Memory**      | Own memory space                 | Shared memory within process |
| **Creation**    | Heavy, slow                      | Lightweight, fast            |
| **Isolation**   | Fully isolated                   | Less isolated, share data    |
| **Safety**      | Safer, one crash ≠ all crash     | Prone to race conditions     |
| **Use Case**    | Separate apps (browser, editor)  | Multiple tasks in app        |

**Examples:**

- **Processes:** Chrome and Word, each with its memory.
- **Threads:** Multiple HTTP request handlers in a web server, sharing cache.

### Thread Pools & Worker Models

#### Thread Pools

- **What:** Pre-created pool of threads reused for multiple tasks.
- **Why:** Avoids the overhead of creating/destroying threads per task.
- **Where:** Web servers (ASP.NET Core, Java, Python), database connection pooling.

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8);
pool.submit(() -> {
    // handle request
});
```

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process_task(task_id):
    print(f"Processing {task_id}")

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    for i in range(10):
        executor.submit(process_task, i)
```

A simpler variant for a request handler:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process_request(request):
    # Handle request
    pass

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    for req in incoming_requests:
        executor.submit(process_request, req)
```

#### Worker Model

- **What:** Tasks are distributed to idle workers from a shared queue.
- **Why:** Improves scalability and balances CPU utilization.
- **Where:** Background job processing, e.g., RabbitMQ workers.

```javascript
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
const tasks = [/* ... */]; // some task list

tasks.forEach(task => {
  const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { workerData: task });
  worker.on('message', result => console.log(result));
});
```

### Asynchronous Processing

**Why Async?**

- Avoids blocking threads on I/O (file, DB, network).
- Boosts throughput, keeps system responsive.

**Techniques:**

- Async/await (C#, JS, Python).
- Promises/Futures.
- Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka).

```javascript
async function getUserData(id) {
  const user = await db.findUserById(id); // Non-blocking I/O
  return user;
}
```

### Concurrency in Web Servers

| Traditional Servers          | Modern Servers                         |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Spawn thread/process/request | Use async / non-blocking I/O           |
| High resource usage          | Event loop or thread pool models       |
| Hard to scale                | Efficient, handles more with less      |

**Modern examples:**

- **Node.js:** Event-loop, non-blocking I/O.
- **ASP.NET Core / Nginx:** Thread pools + async I/O.

### Common Pitfalls: Race Conditions & Deadlocks

#### Race Condition

- Occurs when multiple threads access/modify shared data unsafely.
- Can corrupt data or cause unpredictable bugs.
- **Fix:** Synchronize access (locks, mutexes).

```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(1000):
        with lock:
            counter += 1
```

#### Deadlock

- Threads stuck waiting for each other's resources.
- System can freeze.
- **Fix:** Lock ordering, timeouts, avoiding nested locks.

### Concurrency — Best Practices

- Prefer async/non-blocking I/O for I/O-bound tasks.
- Use thread pools for CPU-bound work, not raw threads.
- Always synchronize access to shared data.
- Detect & avoid deadlocks (consistent lock ordering).
- Monitor performance with appropriate metrics.

**Real-world scenarios:**

- Web servers (Node.js/ASP.NET): Thread pool + async I/O.
- Background jobs (RabbitMQ, Kafka): Worker model.
- Parallel image rendering: Each frame on different core.

## Database Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Replication

**Replication** is the process of copying and maintaining database objects in multiple places. Critical for:

- **High availability:** If one node fails, replicas ensure continued service.
- **Load balancing:** Distribute read traffic among replicas.
- **Disaster recovery:** Data is safe even if a site goes down.

**Types of replication:**

- **Master-Slave Replication:** One primary (master) handles writes, read-only slaves handle queries.
- **Master-Master Replication:** Multiple primaries handle reads and writes, offering redundancy.

(See `image-19.png` for Master-Slave vs Master-Master diagram.)

> **Tip:** Use master-slave for simple read scaling; master-master for HA and fault tolerance, but beware of write conflicts.

### 2. Sharding & Partitioning

#### Sharding

**Sharding** splits large datasets across multiple servers (shards), each holding a subset of the data. Enables horizontal scaling.

**Example:** Users partitioned by geographic region.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] --> B[Shard 1: US]
    A[Client] --> C[Shard 2: EU]
    A[Client] --> D[Shard 3: ASIA]
```

#### Partitioning

**Partitioning** divides data inside a single database:

- **Range partitioning:** e.g., Orders partitioned by order date.
- **Hash partitioning:** Each record assigned to a partition based on a hash of a key (e.g., user_id).

```sql
-- Example: Range Partitioning by Order Date (Postgres)
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at date NOT NULL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

CREATE TABLE orders_2023 PARTITION OF orders
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2023-12-31');
```

> **Tip:** Sharding is for scaling *across servers*; partitioning is for organizing data *within a server*.

### 3. CAP Theorem (Performance Perspective)

The **CAP Theorem** states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of:

- **Consistency:** All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Availability:** Every request gets a response (even if not the latest).
- **Partition Tolerance:** System works even if network splits occur.

| Type | Guarantees                       | Use When…                            |
|------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| CP   | Consistency + Partition Tolerance | Banking, strong consistency needed   |
| AP   | Availability + Partition Tolerance | Social feeds, eventual consistency OK |

> **Performance note:** Prioritizing availability (AP) often improves performance at scale but may introduce temporary inconsistencies.

### 4. Indexes

An **index** is a data structure (like a B-tree or hash table) that lets the database quickly find data without scanning every row.

(See `image-20.png` for index types.)

**Types of indexes:**

- **B-Tree:** Default in most DBs; supports range and exact queries.
- **Hash:** Fast for equality lookups; no range support.
- **Full-Text:** For searching large blocks of text.
- **Bitmap:** Efficient for columns with few unique values (low cardinality).

**When to use:**

- **Read-heavy operations:** Indexes speed up query performance.
- **Write-heavy systems:** Be cautious — indexes can slow down inserts and updates.

```sql
-- B-Tree index (default)
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON users (id);

-- Hash index (Postgres)
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email_hash ON users USING hash (email);

-- Full text (Postgres)
CREATE INDEX idx_article_content ON articles USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', content));

-- Adding a regular email index
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);
```

> **Tip:** Indexes accelerate reads but slow down writes. Use them judiciously.

### 5. Normalization vs. Denormalization

(See `image-21.png` for diagram.)

#### Normalization

- **Goal:** Reduce data redundancy by organizing data into tables.
- **Benefits:** Minimizes storage costs and eliminates anomalies.
- **Drawback:** Can lead to complex joins and slower read performance.
- Splits data into related tables to reduce redundancy. Ideal for transactional (OLTP) systems.

#### Denormalization

- **Goal:** Introduce redundancy to reduce join operations and speed up reads.
- **Benefits:** Faster read performance.
- **Drawback:** Increased storage and potential data anomalies.
- Best for reporting/analytics (OLAP).

#### When to Use Each

- **Normalization:** For transactional systems (OLTP).
- **Denormalization:** For reporting systems or read-heavy workloads.

**Example:**

- *Normalized:* Separate `users` and `orders` tables, joined by `user_id`.
- *Denormalized:* Store user info directly in `orders` for faster reporting.

```sql
-- Normalized
SELECT u.name, o.amount
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- Denormalized: No join needed
SELECT customer_name, amount
FROM orders_denormalized;
```

> **Tip:** Normalize for consistency; denormalize for read performance (especially in reporting / data warehouse scenarios).

### 6. Connection Pooling

(See `image-22.png` for diagram.)

**Definition:** A technique to manage database connections efficiently by **reusing established connections** instead of creating new ones each time.

**Why use it?**

- **Reduces overhead** caused by frequent connection creation and teardown.
- **Helps handle** a large number of concurrent connections effectively.

```python
# Python with SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine(
    'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db',
    pool_size=20, max_overflow=0
)
```

A `psycopg2` example:

```python
from psycopg2 import pool

db_pool = pool.SimpleConnectionPool(1, 20, user='user', password='pass', database='db')

def get_conn():
    return db_pool.getconn()
```

A Node.js + Postgres example:

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ max: 10 });

pool.query('SELECT * FROM products', (err, res) => { /* ... */ });
```

> **Tip:** Always use connection pooling for web apps and microservices to avoid exhausting DB resources under load.

### 7. Query Optimization

Techniques to make queries run faster:

- **Use indexes** (as above).
- **Avoid N+1 queries:** Fetch all needed data in one query using joins or batching.
- **Optimize joins:** Join only necessary tables, and ensure join columns are indexed.

```sql
-- Bad: N+1
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 123;
-- Then for each order...
SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE order_id = ?;

-- Good: Use JOIN
SELECT o.*, oi.*
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.user_id = 123;
```

### 8. Materialized Views

(See `image-23.png` for diagram.)

**Definition:** A precomputed query result stored as a table.

**Benefits:**

- **Speeds up query performance** by avoiding real-time computation.
- Useful in **reporting** and **data warehousing**.

**Use cases:**

- Data aggregation or summary data that doesn't change frequently.
- Reporting systems where fast retrieval is critical.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT region, SUM(total)
FROM sales
GROUP BY region;

-- Refresh periodically as needed
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```

### 9. Batching & Pagination

#### Batching

- **Definition:** Sending multiple operations in a single request or transaction to reduce overhead.
- **Use case:** Bulk inserts or updates.

#### Pagination

- **Definition:** Breaking large sets of data into smaller chunks for efficient retrieval.
- **Prevents** large queries that could lead to timeouts or memory issues.
- **Ensures** responsive UI by fetching data incrementally.

```sql
-- Batch Insert (Postgres)
INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES
  ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
  ('Bob', 'bob@example.com');

-- Pagination
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id LIMIT 50 OFFSET 100;
```

> **Tip:** Always paginate API and UI queries to prevent performance bottlenecks.

## Performance Anti-Patterns (and How to Fix Them)

### 1. Cache Stampede / Thundering Herd

A popular key expires. **1,000 concurrent requests** all miss the cache simultaneously and all hit the database. The DB falls over.

**Fixes (in order of complexity):**
1. **Randomized TTL** — instead of `TTL = 60s`, use `TTL = 60s ± 5s` so keys don't all expire at the same moment.
2. **Lock on regeneration** — first request that misses takes a lock, regenerates the value, others wait. Use Redis SETNX or distributed locks.
3. **Probabilistic early expiration** — regenerate slightly before expiry, in the background. Avoids the cliff entirely.

### 2. N+1 Query Problem

You fetch 100 users, then loop and run `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?` for each. That's **1 + 100 = 101 queries** instead of 1.

```python
# BAD
users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 100")
for user in users:
    user.orders = db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?", user.id)

# GOOD — single JOIN
results = db.query("""
    SELECT u.*, o.*
    FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
    LIMIT 100
""")
```

> **Most ORMs make this easy to hit accidentally.** Use eager loading (`.includes` in Rails, `selectinload` in SQLAlchemy, `Include` in EF).

### 3. Database Connection Pool Sized Wrong

Common mistake: setting pool size to a huge number like 500, assuming "more is better."

**Reality:** PostgreSQL recommends `connections ≈ ((core_count × 2) + effective_spindle_count)`. For an 8-core SSD-backed DB that's about **20 connections.** Past that, context-switching overhead and lock contention slow things down.

**Use a pooler** (PgBouncer, ProxySQL) if you have many app servers. App-level pool stays small; pooler multiplexes.

### 4. Blocking I/O on Hot Path

A 5 ms log-to-disk call doesn't sound bad — until you do it on every request and your p99 doubles.

**Fix:** offload I/O to a background queue or async logger. The hot path should *never* block on disk/network for non-essential work.

### 5. Synchronous Calls in a Chain

Service A → Service B → Service C, all synchronous. Total latency = sum of all three; failure of any one fails the whole request.

**Fix:** parallelize where possible (call B and C concurrently); make non-essential calls async; use circuit breakers.

## Cache Patterns — The Full Picture

| Pattern        | How it works                                                           | Use when                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cache-aside** (lazy loading) | App reads cache; on miss, reads DB and populates cache | Default for read-heavy data with infrequent writes |
| **Read-through** | App always reads cache; cache itself fetches from DB on miss          | When you want app code to not know about the DB |
| **Write-through** | Writes go to cache and DB at the same time                            | Strong consistency requirement; OK with write latency |
| **Write-back** (write-behind) | Writes go to cache; DB updated async                         | Write-heavy; can tolerate data loss on cache crash |
| **Write-around** | Writes go directly to DB, bypassing cache                              | Writes rarely re-read soon (cold data) |

> **For most apps, cache-aside is the right default.** Simple, predictable, doesn't require special cache libraries.

## Combined Tips & Tricks

A consolidated master list drawn from all sections.

### Monitoring & Metrics

- **Always monitor:** Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog.
- **Set SLOs/SLAs:** Make performance measurable and accountable.
- **Track percentiles:** P95 and P99 are often more important than the average.
- **Watch for bottlenecks:** They often hide until your system is under stress.
- **Document your performance strategy:** Make it part of your architecture, not an afterthought.

### Testing

- **Test under real conditions:** Simulate both steady load and traffic spikes.
- **Test under load:** Locust, JMeter, k6 to simulate concurrency issues before production.

### Caching

- **Cache wisely:** Cache only what's expensive or slow to compute, and ensure consistency.
- **Apply TTL smartly:** Especially on volatile or time-sensitive data.
- **Prevent cache stampede:** Use locks or request coalescing.
- **Automate cache invalidation:** Design carefully for dynamic content.

### Messaging

- **Design for failure:** Ensure your queue/message broker can handle spikes and outages.
- **Make consumers idempotent:** Especially in queuing systems with at-least-once delivery.

### Concurrency

- **Use thread pools:** Avoid creating/destroying threads for each task.
- **Async for I/O-bound, thread pool for CPU-bound.**
- **Always use locks for shared data:** Protect shared variables with mutexes/locks.
- **Avoid nested locks:** Keep locking hierarchy simple to reduce deadlock risk.
- **Prefer async/non-blocking I/O:** Especially for I/O-bound tasks.

### Database

- **Tune your DB:** Indexes, sharding, connection pooling, and query optimization all matter.
- **Use prepared statements:** Prevent SQL injection and improve plan caching.
- **Minimize data transfer:** Fetch only required columns.
- **Use connection pools:** For efficient database access.
- **Batch writes:** Aggregate writes where possible to reduce DB round-trips.
- **Async processing:** Offload heavy/slow tasks to background workers.
- **Paginate large datasets:** Never fetch "all" in production APIs.
- **Profile & test:** Use `EXPLAIN` in SQL to analyze query plans.
- **Automate index management:** Remove unused indexes and tune existing ones.
